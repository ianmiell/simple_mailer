simple mailer
=============

As simple a gmail mailer as I could write.

I wanted to send mails from a server from my gmail account to alert me to things on my server with as little fuss as possible.

After searching for some time for something suitable which required minimal installation, and after following various googled webpage guides and failing to make anything work I decided it would be simpler and more instructive to write my own smtp client.

I'm sure something like this has been written by someone smarter than me, but the deed is done now.

This is not written with security, efficiency or scalability in mind.
